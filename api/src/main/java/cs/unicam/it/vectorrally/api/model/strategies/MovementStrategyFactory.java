/**
 * A functional interface representing a factory for creating instances of
 * {@link MovementStrategy}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for instantiating specific
 * types of {@link MovementStrategy} objects. This interface is typically used
 * in conjunction with a {@code Map} that associates a {@link Strategy} enum value
 * with the corresponding factory, allowing for flexible and dynamic creation
 * of different movement strategies.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Example Usage</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Map<Strategy, MovementStrategyFactory> strategyFactories = new HashMap<>();
 * strategyFactories.put(Strategy.SIMPLE, SimpleMovementStrategy::new);
 * strategyFactories.put(Strategy.MEDIUM, () -> new MediumMovementStrategy(track));
 *
 * MovementStrategy strategy = strategyFactories.get(Strategy.SIMPLE).create();
 * }
